            <summary>What are the most surreal places to visit?</summary>
            <div class="faq__content">
                <p> Some of the strangest places on earth are also the most sublime: from the UFO-like dragon's blood trees in Yemen to a rainbow-colored hot spring in Yellowstone to a bridge in Germany that looks like a leftover prop from Lord of the Rings.

            <div class="faq__content">
                <p>The beauty of travel is that it’s accessible to everyone, in some form. You don't have to go far to experience a new culture. Plus there are several ways to make most flights affordable, whether by being flexible, searching on new websites
                    like Skypicker and Fareness, or just by planning ahead. Know the best time to book a flight: 57 days in advance for domestic flights, 117 for international. Then again, you could just make traveling the world your 9-to-5.</p>

            <summary>What are some common items savvy travelers bring with them (that less-savvy travelers don’t)?</summary>
            <div class="faq__content">
                <p>Don’t forget a small power strip—ideal for sharing a crowded outlet in an airport, and a simple way to keep all devices close by once at a hotel. (Combine that with a Zolt—which powers a laptop and two devices with a charger the size of
                    a lipstick—and it’s even handier.) Keep a photograph of your luggage and passport on your smartphone; lose either of them, and you’ll be grateful for the reference. Pack a scarf—always. And since calling Nespresso coffee is an insult
                    to baristas everywhere, the best in-room alternate is the Aeropress, a nifty gizmo that’s portable, light, and makes killer morning joe almost anywhere.</p>

            <div class="faq__content">
                <p>There’s no better Bible of in-flight secrets than Air Babylon, a rollicking romp through 24 hours at an airport compiling anonymous tell-alls from a raft of staff. One sample tidbit: Aviation law decrees that after an onboard death (more
                    common than you’d imagine), planes must land at the nearest airport. No airline wants to pay fines for being delayed, so no one is officially declared dead on board until the plane is landing at its destination.</p>
