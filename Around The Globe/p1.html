                    Our planet is so full of amazingly gorgeous places, it's almost too hard to choose which ones we want to see in our lifetime. Unfortunately, we might never be able to see some of them. Famous areas around the world are in danger disappearing—and fast.
                    Due to the effects of climate change, development, and tourism, some of our very favorite world landmarks and places are slowly dying, and they might soon be gone forever. Here's a list of 30 all of the places you need to see sooner

            <hr>
            <div class="card-body-p4">

                <p class="card-text">
                    The Caribbean is made up of over 5,000 islands, reefs, and cays, each with its own unique attractions and price ranges. In recent years, even very secluded islands have been transformed into some of the world’s most exclusive vacationing destinations.
                    There is a misconception that a vacation to the Caribbean will be extremely expensive and not a viable region of the world for budget travelers.But that’s not true. After all, this is a huge region and all the islands are different!
                    You can definitely visit the Caribbean on a budget. Sure, while accommodation can be expensive, costs of food and activities vary greatly island to island. With so many places to choose from in this guide, you’ll find a corner of the
                    Caribbean suitable to your budget. Trust me. I’ve been to a lot of the countries in this part of the world (I love a good beach!). This Caribbean travel guide will help point the way by giving you tips on what to see, costs, suggested
                    budgets, ways to save money, and everything else you need to plan a great trip!<br><br>
                    <h4> <b>---------------------------------------------------------------Other Things to See and Do in the Caribbean-----------------------------------------------------------</b><br><br>
                    </h4>
                    <h5>1. Sample rum at the Mount Gay Rum Distillery, Barbados</h5>
                    <p>Barbados is the birthplace of rum, and Mount Gay the oldest continuously running rum distillery in the world. (They’ve been doing it for over 300 years!) For $10 USD you can tour the Mount Gay Rum Distillery – and you get huge discounts
                        on Mount Gay at the end too!</p>
                    <h5>2. Learn about Reggae’s roots, Jamaica</h5>
                    <p>Jamaica is home to reggae music, and there’s little chance of you going anywhere in Jamaica and not hearing Bob Marley’s beats blaring in the background. Make the pilgrimage to his museum, the large house on Hope Road in Kingston,
                        where he lived and worked between 1975-1981. You’ll learn more about the iconic Rastafarian’s life, with glimpses into his recording studio and bedroom. Admission is $25 USD.</p>
                    <h5>3. Splash around Dunn’s River Falls, Jamaica</h5>
                    <p>This is the most popular visitor attraction in Jamaica. Located in Ocho Rios, these falls cascading over plateaus are 600 feet high and are stunning. For those who are adventurous enough, you can climb up them — but for everyone else,
                        walk the trail that follows the river or go for a swim in one of the many azure pools at the base of the falls. Entry $20 USD.</p>
                    <h5>4. Go snorkeling or diving</h5>
                    <p>Divers and even snorkelers can visit shipwrecks and coral reefs in the waters surrounding the islands. In the Bahamas, the Tongue of the Ocean is an oceanic trench that runs along the entire length of the Andros Island coast. The wall
                        of the trench leads to an almost 6,000 feet drop to the seabed where divers can get up close and personal with reef sharks as they swarm in to feed. Two-tank drives start from $120 USD. St. Lucia is another great place to explore
                        the ocean for its clear Caribbean waters and a vast array of sea creatures, including parrotfish, trumpet fish, and needlefish, especially in the Anse Chastanet Reef. Diving costs start around $90 USD for a two-tank dive and snorkeling
                        costs from $60 USD.</p>
                    <h5>5. Go zip-lining in St. Lucia</h5>
                    <p>If you’re looking for an adventurous break from sun-tanning, try zip-lining through the rain forest canopy. Adventure Tours St. Lucia has a total of 12 lines, including the highest, longest, and fastest line on the island. There are
                        also five net bridges and lots of opportunities to catch some gorgeous views over St. Lucia. You’ll pay 230 XCD ($85 USD) for a full day of zip lining.</p>
                    <h5>6. Visit Antigua</h5>
                    <p>Antigua is one of the largest Caribbean islands, with over 365 pink and white beaches (including Dickenson Bay and Pigeon Point Beach). If you’re into sailing, sign up to be a deckhand or observe Sailing Week at the end of April, the
                        world-renowned regatta featuring 150-200 yachts and more than 1,500 participants.</p>
                    <h5>7. See the world’s “wickedest” city, Jamaica</h5>
                    <p>Most travelers don’t venture into Jamaica’s eastern parish of Portland — it’s an area off the tourist trail and a nice alternative to the crowds on the coast. But if you do come here, you’ll be rewarded with peaceful beaches, endless
                        natural beauty, and friendly locals who aren’t afraid to chat you up. While you’re here, visit the Blue Lagoon, see Somerset Falls, and sample plenty of jerk chicken in the town of Boston.</p>
                    <h5>8. Kayak around the islands</h5>
                    <p>One of the best ways to explore these islands by water, but if you can’t afford your own powerboat, a half-day kayaking tour is a great alternative. One of the best kayaking experiences is with Clear Kayak <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/caribbean-travel-tips/aruba/"
                            target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aruba</a>. Their clear-bottomed kayaks let you see the reefs and coral beneath you, and a two-hour paddle costs $60 USD. Prices will vary by island (and sometimes your hotel may
                        have rent them out), but you can expect to pay around $100 USD on average for a full-day tour.</p>
                    <h5>9. Pretend you’re a pirate, Bahamas</h5>
                    <p>If you’re looking for more pirate culture, check out the Pirates of Nassau Museum in the Bahamas dedicated to the history of piracy. You’ll walk around replica pirate ships, visit the dungeon, and learn through interactive exhibits
                        about how pirates set up base here between 1690 and 1720. Admission is $13.50 USD for adults and $6.75 USD for children.</p>
                    <h5>10. Go nude at Salomon’s Beach, St. John</h5>
                    <p>Once a secluded nude beach, authorities have been cracking down in recent years on anyone caught not wearing clothing. Nevertheless, many people push their luck and hit the sand in nothing but their birthday suit. Are you bold enough
                        to risk the $100 fine?</p>
                    <h5>11. Lose yourself in the clouds, Jamaica</h5>
                    <p>Holywell National Park lies in the Blue Mountain region of Jamaica and is one of the most accessible areas in the mountains. Several short treks around here will have you wandering upward into a cloud forest, surrounded by colorful
                        birds (like hummingbirds!) and screeching monkeys. A short drive from Kingston, this tropical park can easily be visited in one afternoon. Park entrance is $10 USD.</p>
                    <h5>12. Celebrate Carnival, St. John</h5>
                    <p>St. John’s Carnival takes place in late June and traditionally culminates with a 4th of July parade, as Islanders also celebrate the United States’ Independence Day. It features mocko jumbies, calypso music, the crowning of Ms. St.
                        John and the Carnival King. Spectacular fireworks are shot into the air at the festival.</p>
                    <h5>13. Explore the Hato Caves, Curacao</h5>
                    <p>These caves were once hiding spots for escaped slaves who would hide in them for weeks or even months at a time. You can take a guided tour and see the stalagmites, stalactites and cave drawings, which date back 1,500 years. Admission
                        is $9 USD, including the tour. It’s open daily from 9AM-4PM, and tours are every hour on the hour.</p>
                    <h5>14. Visit the Baths, British Virgin Islands</h5>
                    <p>After crawling through a tiny opening, you are surrounded by gigantic granite boulders nestled on each other with streams of water flowing all around them. There are nooks and crannies to explore everywhere. After wading through, enjoy
                        the calm and beauty of Dead Man’s Beach. Simply, the Baths are beautiful.</p>

            <h2 class="card-header">Travel Tips – 4 Habits A Traveller Must Adopts</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="card-body-p5">
                <p class="card-text">
                    <p>When one thinks of travelling, one generally considers the positives which include sightseeing, exploring new destinations, savouring new food etc. but no one considers the situation that one may face in case of an unfortunate incident.
                        Misplacing your luggage during transit, losing your important documents, getting sick or having something stolen, these are some unforeseen incidents that can also happen during a journey. We list out 4 travel habits that all travellers
                        must take up to ensure to be prepared for any setback in the middle of a trip.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Best way to travel with money – Keep cash and plastic money in different places</strong></h2>
                    <p>While travelling overseas, it is a traveller’s nightmare to become a victim of pickpocketing or theft, which will leave them stranded in a foreign country. Therefore, it is advised that you keep your cash and plastic money (debit/credit
                        cards) in more places than one. For e.g. put some money in your wallet, a little amount in laptop bag, likewise separate amount in cabin bag and the rest in main luggage/trolley bag. This way, in the unfortunate case of a theft
                        or misplaced luggage, you are not left high dry without money. Another recommendation is to write down where you have kept your money, in case you are one of those forgetful souls.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Best way to pack – Keep socks and underclothes in cabin bag</strong></h2>
                    <p>Losing your luggage in a foreign country is not only traumatic but a cue signalling the start of a lot of hassles for you. Not only do you have to undergo the hassle to notify the authorities, place your luggage and get it back from
                        the airport, you will also have to endure wearing the same clothes and underclothes all the while (or you buy new ones). Nevertheless, it is a huge hassle. Therefore, it is a good idea to keep socks and your underclothes in your
                        cabin bag so that you can have some respite in worst case scenario.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Charging your gadgets before leaving</strong></h2>
                    <p>With completing all the travelling procedure, checking-in, waiting for your flight, reaching your destination, checking-out of the airport, it is possible that a charging outlet might be difficult to find. So it is best not to depend
                        on public places like the airport for your gadget charging needs as it might be occupied by others as well. Make sure you charge all your devices the night before.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Take picture of important travel details</strong></h2>
                    <p>Most travellers tend to forget their hotel room number or parking space spot (in case of a rented car parked somewhere). Therefore, it is better to take pictures of important details such as these, as it will be difficult to carry

            <hr>
            <div class="card-body-p6">
                <p class="card-text">
                    <p>It’s one of the first questions asked by anyone considering a round the world trip: how much will it cost?</p>
                    <p>This is my best shot at nailing down just how much it costs to travel around the world. It’s tricky to give an exact answer to this question, because every trip is based on different variables like destinations, timing, and traveling
                        style.

                        <h2>Which variables affect costs?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>When you go</strong> – Timing&nbsp;has a huge influence on the overall cost of an around-the-world trip. Prices in a given location can vary wildly depending on the time of year you’re there&nbsp;(also known as <a title="5 Factors That Affect Ticket Price"
                                    href="https://www.airtreks.com/ready/where-do-you-want-to-go/factors-that-affect-ticket-price/">seasonality</a>).</li>
                            <li><strong>Where you go</strong> – Some parts of the world are more expensive than others. Europe, the United States, Australia, and Japan are going to cost more. India, Southeast Asia, and Central America will bring the cost
                                down.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What you do when you’re there</strong> – Going out for adventures every day will bring up the total cost of your trip. Skydives, snorkeling, dune buggies, and ski slopes&nbsp;aren’t cheap!</li>
                            <li><strong>Your accommodations </strong>– hostels, hotels, guest houses, long-term rentals. The level of luxury you choose will have&nbsp;a huge effect on your trip’s cost.</li>
                            <li><strong>The type of food you eat</strong> – Eating at street vendors, supermarkets, restaurants, local homes or Buddhist monasteries…where you eat will alter your food budget.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>What’s generally included in the cost of a round-the-world trip?</h2>
                        <p>There are really only a few things that people spend their money on when they travel:<br><br><strong>Plane tickets</strong> – Getting from region to region. The average cost of an AirTreks ticket tends to be in the $2500 – $3500
                            range per person, including taxes. Over the last twenty&nbsp;years this number has remained fairly&nbsp;consistent. You can estimate the <a title="TripPlanner" href="http://tripplanner.airtreks.com/HtmlUi?AFFID=AIRTREKS&amp;DST=HOW_MUCH">cost of your airfare&nbsp;with our TripPlanner</a>.
                            If you need a generalized price for your budget, use&nbsp;$3300. If your trip comes in lower, that’s a bonus! Of course, <a href="https://www.airtreks.com/ready/business-class-around-the-world/">business class will run a little extra</a>.<br><br><strong>Accommodations</strong>                            – These can range from the most barebones dormitory-style hostel to a fairly luxurious hotel or resort. Of course you can mix and match over the course of your trip. After plane tickets, accommodations will be the most expensive
                            part of your travel budget.&nbsp;Plan on $20-40 per night in inexpensive regions and $90-150 in expensive ones. If you plan on hostels every night, much less. In cheap areas you can find a dormitory for under $5 and even in
                            the most expensive areas, it’s rare to find one over $25.<br><br><strong>Food/Drink</strong> – This item can range from supermarket picnicking, to street food, to restaurants. This will vary from meal to meal. Plan on $1-5
                            per meal per person in inexpensive regions and $5-20 per meal per person in expensive ones.<br><br><strong>Activities</strong> – These are things like tours, museums, adventure activities, elephant riding. Of course you’re
                            going to spend money on doing things.&nbsp;Can range from $5 to $200 each, depending on the activity and location.<br><br><strong>Ground transportation</strong> – This includes buses, trains, ferries, taxis, moto-rickshaws,
                            regular rickshaws, tuk-tuks, barges, speedboats, motorcycle rentals.&nbsp;Costs vary depending on how far you’re going and how fast. Taking a moto across town in Africa costs less than a dollar. Renting a Mercedes in Dubai
                            might cost $500. Generally, though, ground transportation is a small fraction of your expenses.<br>

                        <h2>Here’s how much a round the world trip&nbsp;will cost*</h2>
                        <p>The&nbsp;general consensus from travelers who’ve&nbsp;done these trips is that a year on the road costs somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000.<br><br>However, that is just the middle of the bell curve. If you prefer to live in
                            the lap of luxury, flying in business class and staying at the Four Seasons, you’re going to have to pay a lot more than that. But if you’re a lowly backpacker, you could potentially travel the world for a year on $6,000 (it
                            has been done!)&nbsp;For the sake of argument, let’s average a comfortable RTW year-long trip at $24,000. If you break that down monthly,<strong> a Round the World&nbsp;trip will cost one person around $2,000 per month,&nbsp;</strong>taking
                            everything into consideration. For many people it’s cheaper to be on the road than staying at home.<br><br><em>*This shouldn’t be taken as a hard and fast number, since variables for your particular traveling style are numerous.</em><br><br>Keep
                            in mind that the longer the trip, the less you spend on a daily basis simply because you don’t need to fill each day with activities&nbsp;or&nbsp;spending expensive time in airports. This is the reason why we’ve said that

                            hard numbers on how much a round the world trip cost, there’s a selection of travel bloggers who have posted their numbers online for all to compare and to evaluate. The travel blog Jack and Jill Travel has <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
